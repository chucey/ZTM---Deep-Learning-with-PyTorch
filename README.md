# ZTM - Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repository contains my notebooks from the lessons taught in the Zero to Mastery PyTorch Bootcamp course. The course covered topics such as:

- PyTorch Basics such as:
  - What are Tensors
  - Tensor Operations and Manupulations
- Linear Regression with PyTorch
- Image CLassification using:
  - Built in Datasets (Food101, CIFA10)
  - Custom Dataset (20% of the Food101 dataset)
- Converting code in a notebook to a Python script (Going Modular)
- Transfer Learning
- Paper Replication
- Model Deployment

I have also deployed 2 models:

1. [Foodvision_big](https://huggingface.co/spaces/chucey/foodvision_big) - This model allows the the user to upload an image of a food and will show what type of food it is. This model can predict 101 diffeent types of food. The code base can be found [here.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/chucey/foodvision_big/tree/main)
2. [Foodvision_mini](https://huggingface.co/spaces/chucey/foodvision_mini) - This model allows the the user to upload an image of a food and will show what type of food it is. This model can predict food as either "pizza," "steak" or "sushi. The code base can be found [here.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/chucey/foodvision_mini/tree/main)
