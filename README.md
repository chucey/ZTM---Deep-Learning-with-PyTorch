# ZTM - Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repository contains my notebooks from the lessons taught in the Zero to Mastery PyTorch Bootcamp course. The course covered topics such as:

- PyTorch Basics such as:
  - What are Tensors
  - Tensor Operations and Manupulations
- Linear Regression with PyTorch
- Image CLassification using:
  - Built in Datasets (Food101, CIFA10)
  - Custom Dataset (20% of the Food101 dataset)
- Converting code in a notebook to a Python script (Going Modular)
- Transfer Learning
- Paper Replication
- Model Deployment
